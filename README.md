go-lepton
=========

Serves images taken on a FLIR Lepton connected to a Raspberry Pi SPI port to
over HTTP.


Accessing SPI without root
--------------------------

To be able to use the SPI port on the Raspberry Pi without root, run the
following:

    sudo groupadd -f --system spi
    sudo adduser $USER spi
    echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="spidev", GROUP="spi"' | sudo tee --append /etc/udev/rules.d/90-spi.rules > /dev/null
    sudo shutdown -r now

Then connect the port as shown at
https://github.com/PureEngineering/LeptonModule/wiki

This removes the requirement of running random program as root just to access
the SPI port.


Updating Raspbian
-----------------

If using Raspbian, before playing with this project, make sure to update as
described at http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md to
use a recent linux kernel:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo rpi-update
    sudo shutdown -r now


Performance
-----------

Reading the SPI port currently saturate the CPU of a Raspberry Pi v1 running
Raspbian.

Not sure how to improve the situation but this leaves absolutely no room for
any computation.

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/spi/spi-bcm2835.c implies
that the FIFO buffer is 16 bytes deep but the packets sent are 164 bytes, as
required by the Lepton.
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/spi/spidev
implies it's not a requirement to use ioctl() for full duplex operation and a
simple read() would be sufficent. Will be investigated later as the Lepton
doesn't read any data through the SPI port, only via iÂ²c.
